# Software version
PyTorch 1.9.0. Python version is 3.9.7. CUDA version is 11.2.

These python files require some basic scientific computing python packages, e.g., numpy. I recommend users to install python via Anaconda (python 3.9.7), which can be downloaded from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section . If you have installed Anaconda, then you do not need to worry about these basic packages.

After you install anaconda and PyTorch, you can run codes successfully. Good luck!

# Code
You can run 
```
python main_sys.py 
```
--> get results on the synthetic dataset.

You can run 
```
python main_weather.py 
```
--> get results on the weather dataset.
